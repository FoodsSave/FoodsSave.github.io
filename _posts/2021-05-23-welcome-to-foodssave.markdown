# Welcome to FoodsSave

We are a small of dedicated people working towards a common goal, which is to
save one misshapen fruit or vegetable at a time. According to statistics, rougly
one third of all produced are discarded not because they are not fit for consumption,
but because of the way they look - to some they are simply ugly and to be avoided. 
However, they are in fact just as good as the well shaped fruits and veggies you
normally encounter in the market. 

We will release more information regarding the web app under development in time. 
Please check back later for updates. If you would like to volunteer, please do reach out
by email.
